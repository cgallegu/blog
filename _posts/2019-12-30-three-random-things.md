title: "Three random things"
---

I've wanted to start writing often, many times in the past four years.  
So I'll just start with three random thoughts. I expect this helps me
get the writing juices flowing.

1. I'm learning emacs. I have a vague recollection of the panic emacs
(or some other Unix-y editor) caused me when I realized I did not know
how to exit it. I recall reading that's not uncommon. It took me close
to fifteen years to learn how to do it. Wow.

2. Reading about people that create things motivates me to create things.
I guess it's contagious. Last thing I ran into was [Jaime Zawinski's blog](https://www.jwz.org).
Thanks Jaime, you got me writing this.

3. Music has a lot of questions. More on this later.
