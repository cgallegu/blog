Over the history of mankind, music has captured some, if not the
most pressing questions our species has faced.  

Here, are some of these questions.

## Love (in particular)
* [Is this love?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOJk0HW_hJw)
* [Why can't this be love?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STVcNX7anGU)

## Weather
* [Have you ever seen the rain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu2pVPWGYMQ)
* [Who'll stop the rain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPan-rEQJA)
 
## General relationships
* [Why can't we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FfJ89rGPc) [be friends?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5OXON8vIaA)
* [Are you gonna be my girl?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os7vArsFTws)

## Meta

## Yet to find a category for these
* [Are you gonna go my way?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhCd1W2V0Q)
* [Where did you sleep last night?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEMm7gxBYSc)
  * Though it can be disputed that that's _not_ really the name
* [What happened to you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8sOWiRO3Y)
