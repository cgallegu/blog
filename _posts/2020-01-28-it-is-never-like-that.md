- It should be fairly simple to implement that
It won't.

- It can't be _that_ difficult
It will be borderline impossible.

- That'll take a day or so
Three months in and you're nowhere near finishing it.

- It'll be done by the end of the week
It's Friday PM and you don't even know where to start

And so many others.

Stop being an optimist.  
Be a pessimist and you _might_ end up being a realist.
