## Testing
- [Spock](http://spockframework.org): Groovy based test framework. Less verbose than JUnit, supports Stubs, Mocks, Spies and *data driven testing* (my favorite feature).
- [The Transformation priority premise](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html): Refactorings are simple operations that change the structure of code without changing itâ€™s behavior. Transformations are simple operations that change the behavior of code.

## Optimizing
- Two excellent posts from Jeff Atwood you should read every time you think about optimizing something: [Why aren't my optimizations optimizing](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-arent-my-optimizations-optimizing/), [The sad tragedy of micro optimization theater](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-sad-tragedy-of-micro-optimization-theater/)

## Game development
I grew playing adventure games. I might eventually right one, just for fun. These are the things and people that keep me wanting to do that.

## People (and their blogs)

Likely people here will have their own Wikipedia entry. I'll add some context when that's not the case.
